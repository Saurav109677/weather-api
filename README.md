## Quick Install
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your MEAN application.

The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a `package.json` and `bower.json` files that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
$ npm install
```

This command does a few things:
* First it will install the dependencies needed for the application to run.
* If you're running in a development environment, it will then also install development dependencies needed for testing and running your application.
* When the npm packages install process is over, npm will initiate a bower install command to install all the front-end modules needed for the application
* To update these packages later on, just run `npm update`

## Running Your Application

Run your application using npm:

```bash
$ npm start
```

Your application should run on port 3000 with the *development* environment configuration, so in your browser just go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

That's it! Your application should be running. To proceed with your development, check the other sections in this documentation.
If you encounter any problems, try the Troubleshooting section.

Explore `config/env/development.js` for development environment configuration options.

### Running in Production mode
To run your application with *production* environment configuration:

```bash
$ npm run start:prod
```

Explore `config/env/production.js` for production environment configuration options.

### Running with User Seed
To have default account(s) seeded at runtime:

In Development:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true npm start
```
It will try to seed the users 'user' and 'admin'. If one of the user already exists, it will display an error message on the console. Just grab the passwords from the console.

In Production:
```bash
MONGO_SEED=true npm start:prod
```
This will seed the admin user one time if the user does not already exist. You have to copy the password from the console and save it.
